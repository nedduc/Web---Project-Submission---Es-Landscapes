		I designed my website for Es Landscapes to be very easy and simple to use no-frills, easy clear navigation, no fluff, and just the information needed based on a simple flow chart with a logical and simple road map.<br>The main point on this website was for the user to make contact.<br>The company's telephone number is located clearly at the top of every navigation bar, it should be the first thing users will see based on the Z-index.<br>Every page has a footer with address details and email address that can be clicked onto, every page has a contact - get in touch link.<br><br>
				I put together something that I felt I was able to code. I didn't want to come up with something too elaborate and not be able to build it. After I drew out the flow chart, I decided to do a high fidelity wireframe from Adobe Xd, which I still have to learn fully but had enough down to produce a good wireframe.<br><br>
		The information I wanted to get across on this website was that ES Landscapes are a landscaping company with a difference, a unique selling point. They help you maintain your garden by giving you the skills to learn about your garden in a environmentally friendly way.<br><br>	
				I made sure that the webpage would have design accessibility elements contained, for example, the contrasting colors and larger headings, click on every logo at the navigation bar to return to the home page as well as alternative text for any images for someone who may be visually impaired. Social media is also contained within the footers.<br><br>
				I kept the navigation bar, footer on every page the same, kept the theme running on all pages. I would have liked to use the sticky position on the right leaf on the services page, but could not get it to work. I believe I have been forcing everything to fit where I want it to. In time I know I will have less lines of code on my css file and it will become more streamline.<br><br>Next time the page will be responsive and I will use the custom font 'luther'.
